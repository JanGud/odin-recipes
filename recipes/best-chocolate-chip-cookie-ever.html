    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the <strong>absolute best</strong> chocolate chip cookie I've ever had. Trust me, I've tried changing every possible ration of ingredients and oven time, and this is it.</p>
    <p>Really, no need to keep looking. You've arrived. This is peak cookie.</p>
    <p>This recipe is for aprox. 16 cookies</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 3/4 cups all-prupose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>14 tablespoons unsalted butter (seriously)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon table salt (less if you used salted butter before because you're a rebel)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips/chunks (I prefer chunks)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped pecans or walnuts, roasted (If you like them, obviously. I don't but I'm being nice and saying how much)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Avoid using a nonstick skillet to brown the butter; the dark color of the nonstick coating makes it difficult to gauge when the butter is browned. Also, if you want more crumbly and less chewy, you can increase the ratio of granulated sugar vs brown sugar. I like them chewy, so these have a little more brown sugar than granulated sugar.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ajust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375F or 190C. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Whisk baking flour and soda together in a medium bowl; set aside</li>
        <li>Heat 10 tablespoons butter in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking, swirling pan constantly until butter is dark golden brown and has a nutty aroma, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and, using heatproof spatula, transfer browned butter to large heatproof bowl. Stir remaining 4 tablespoons butter into hot butter until completely melted.</li>
        <li>Add both sugars, salt, and vanilla to bowl with butter and whisk until mixture is smooth with no sugar lumps remaining, about 30 seconds. Let mixture stand 3 minutes, then whisk for 30 seconds. Repeat process of resting and whisking 2 more times until mixture is thick, smooth and shiny.</li>
        <li>Using rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir in flour mixture until just combined, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in chocolate chips and nuts (if you're nuts for nuts), giving dough final stir to ensure no flour pockets remain</li>
