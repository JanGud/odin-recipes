This Project intends to create a basic recipe website as a way to exercise the HTML knowledge aquired so far.

Started using URLs for images, but decided to download the images so I'm not hostage to someone else.

On the last update, added CSS to practice. Used it to fix how images appeared in the layout, mainly, while also changing design elements.
